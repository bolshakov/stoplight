Description:
  Generates stoplight initializer to setup Stoplight Redis configuration
    and optionally sets up Admin panel
  
Examples:
  rails generate stoplight:install

    This will generate "config/initializers/stoplight.rb" initializer with basic config
    Then you should adjust Redis config there.

  rails generate stoplight:install --with-admin-panel

    This will generate initializer and will add a route to the admin panel to your "config/routes.rb" file

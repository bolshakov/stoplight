Description:
  Generates stoplight initializer to setup Stoplight Redis configuration
    and optionally sets up Admin panel
  
Examples:
  rails generate stoplight:install

    This will generate "config/initializers/stoplight.rb" initializer with basic config
    Then you should adjust Redis config there.

  rails generate stoplight:install --with-admin-panel

    This generated all needed requirements to set up Stoplight Admin Panel:
    * It generates initializer "config/initializers/stoplight.rb" with Redis configuration
    * It injects your "config/routes.rb" with route with basic authentication to Stoplight Admin panel
    * It injects your Gemfile with needed dependencies ('redis', 'sinatra' and 'sinatra-contrib')

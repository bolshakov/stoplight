Stoplight is traffic control for code. It's an implementation of the circuit
breaker pattern in Ruby.

---

Does your code use unreliable systems, like a flaky database or a spotty web
service? Wrap calls to those up in stoplights to prevent them from affecting
the rest of your application.

Check out [stoplight-admin][] for controlling your stoplights.

## Installation

Add it to your Gemfile:

``` rb
gem 'stoplight'
```

Or install it manually:

``` sh
$ gem install stoplight
```

Stoplight uses [Semantic Versioning][]. Check out [the change log][] for a
detailed list of changes.

Stoplight works with all supported versions of Ruby (2.1 through 2.3).

## Basic usage

To get started, create a stoplight:

``` rb
light = Stoplight('example-pi') { 22.0 / 7 }
# => #<Stoplight::Light:...>
```

Then you can run it and it will return the result of calling the block. This is
the green state. (The green state corresponds to the closed state for circuit
  breakers.)

``` rb
light.run
# => 3.142857142857143
light.color
# => "green"
```

If everything goes well, you shouldn't even be able to tell that you're using a
stoplight. That's not very interesting though, so let's create a failing
stoplight:

``` rb
light = Stoplight('example-zero') { 1 / 0 }
# => #<Stoplight::Light:...>
```

Now when you run it, the error will be recorded and passed through. After
running it a few times, the stoplight will stop trying and fail fast. This is
the red state. (The red state corresponds to the open state for circuit
  breakers.)

``` rb
light.run
# ZeroDivisionError: divided by 0
light.run
# ZeroDivisionError: divided by 0
light.run
# Switching example-zero from green to red because ZeroDivisionError divided by 0
# ZeroDivisionError: divided by 0
light.run
# Stoplight::Error::RedLight: example-zero
light.color
# => "red"
```

When the stoplight changes from green to red, it will notify every configured
notifier. See [the notifiers section][] to learn more about notifiers.

The stoplight will move into the yellow state after being in the red state for
a while. (The yellow state corresponds to the half open state for circuit
breakers.) To configure how long it takes to switch into the yellow state,
check out [the cool off time section][] When stoplights are yellow, they will
try to run their code. If it fails, they'll switch back to red. If it succeeds,
they'll switch to green.

### Custom errors

Some errors shouldn't cause your stoplight to move into the red state. Usually
these are handled elsewhere in your stack and don't represent real failures. A
good example is `ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound`.

To prevent some errors from changing the state of your stoplight, you can
provide a custom block that will be called with the error and a handler
`Proc`. It can do one of three things:

1.  Re-raise the error. This causes Stoplight to ignore the error. Do this for
    errors like `ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound` that don't represent real
    failures.

2.  Call the handler with the error. This is the default behavior. Stoplight
    will only ignore the error if it shouldn't have been caught in the first
    place. See `Stoplight::Error::AVOID_RESCUING` for a list of errors that
    will be ignored.

3.  Do nothing. This is **not recommended**. Doing nothing causes Stoplight to
    never ignore the error. That means a `NoMemoryError` could change the color
    of your stoplights.

``` rb
light = Stoplight('example-not-found') { User.find(123) }
  .with_error_handler do |error, handle|
    raise error if error.is_a?(ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound)
    handle.call(error)
  end
# => #<Stoplight::Light:...>
light.run
# ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound: Couldn't find User with ID=123
light.run
# ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound: Couldn't find User with ID=123
light.run
# ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound: Couldn't find User with ID=123
light.color
# => "green"
```

### Custom fallback

By default, stoplights will re-raise errors when they're green. When they're
red, they'll raise a `Stoplight::Error::RedLight` error. You can provide a
fallback that will be called in both of these cases. It will be passed the
error if the light was green.

``` rb
light = Stoplight('example-fallback') { 1 / 0 }
  .with_fallback { |e| p e; 'default' }
# => #<Stoplight::Light:..>
light.run
# #<ZeroDivisionError: divided by 0>
# => "default"
light.run
# #<ZeroDivisionError: divided by 0>
# => "default"
light.run
# Switching example-fallback from green to red because ZeroDivisionError divided by 0
# #<ZeroDivisionError: divided by 0>
# => "default"
light.run
# nil
# => "default"
```

### Custom threshold

Some bits of code might be allowed to fail more or less frequently than others.
You can configure this by setting a custom threshold.

``` rb
light = Stoplight('example-threshold') { fail }
  .with_threshold(1)
# => #<Stoplight::Light:...>
light.run
# Switching example-threshold from green to red because RuntimeError
# RuntimeError:
light.run
# Stoplight::Error::RedLight: example-threshold
```

The default threshold is `3`.

### Custom cool off time

Stoplights will automatically attempt to recover after a certain amount of
time. A light in the red state for longer than the cool off period will
transition to the yellow state. This cool off time is customizable.

``` rb
light = Stoplight('example-cool-off') { fail }
  .with_cool_off_time(1)
# => #<Stoplight::Light:...>
light.run
# RuntimeError:
light.run
# RuntimeError:
light.run
# Switching example-cool-off from green to red because RuntimeError
# RuntimeError:
sleep(1)
# => 1
light.color
# => "yellow"
light.run
# RuntimeError:
```

The default cool off time is `60` seconds. To disable automatic recovery, set
the cool off to `Float::INFINITY`. To make automatic recovery instantaneous,
set the cool off to `0` seconds. Note that this is not recommended, as it
effectively replaces the red state with yellow.

### Rails

Stoplight was designed to wrap Rails actions with minimal effort. Here's an
example configuration:

``` rb
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  around_action :stoplight

  private

  def stoplight(&block)
    Stoplight("#{params[:controller]}##{params[:action]}", &block)
      .with_fallback do |error|
        Rails.logger.error(error)
        render(nothing: true, status: :service_unavailable)
      end
      .run
  end
end
```

## Setup

### Data store

Stoplight uses an in-memory data store out of the box.

``` rb
require 'stoplight'
# => true
Stoplight::Light.default_data_store
# => #<Stoplight::DataStore::Memory:...>
```

If you want to use a persistent data store, you'll have to set it up. Currently
the only supported persistent data store is Redis.

#### Redis

Make sure you have [the Redis gem][] (`~> 3.2`) installed before configuring
Stoplight.

``` rb
require 'redis'
# => true
redis = Redis.new
# => #<Redis client ...>
data_store = Stoplight::DataStore::Redis.new(redis)
# => #<Stoplight::DataStore::Redis:...>
Stoplight::Light.default_data_store = data_store
# => #<Stoplight::DataStore::Redis:...>
```

### Notifiers

Stoplight sends notifications to standard error by default.

``` rb
Stoplight::Light.default_notifiers
# => [#<Stoplight::Notifier::IO:...>]
```

If you want to send notifications elsewhere, you'll have to set them up.

#### IO

Stoplight can notify not only into STDOUT, but into any IO object. You can configure 
the `Stoplight::Notifier::IO` notifier for that.

``` rb
require 'stringio'

io = StringIO.new
# => #<StringIO:...>
notifier = Stoplight::Notifier::IO.new(io)
# => #<Stoplight::Notifier::Logger:...>
Stoplight::Light.default_notifiers += [notifier]
# => [#<Stoplight::Notifier::IO:...>  
```

#### Logger

Stoplight can be configured to use [the Logger class][] from the standard
library.

``` rb
require 'logger'
# => true
logger = Logger.new(STDERR)
# => #<Logger:...>
notifier = Stoplight::Notifier::Logger.new(logger)
# => #<Stoplight::Notifier::Logger:...>
Stoplight::Light.default_notifiers += [notifier]
# => [#<Stoplight::Notifier::IO:...>, #<Stoplight::Notifier::Logger:...>]
```

#### Community-supported notifiers

Unfortunately, there aren't any so far. You you want to implement one, the 
following section contains all the required information.

Pull requests to update this section are welcome.

#### How to implement your own notifier?

A notifier has to implement the `Stoplight::Notifier::Base` interface:

```ruby
def notify(light, from_color, to_color, error)
  raise NotImplementedError
end
```

For convenience, you can use the `Stoplight::Notifier::Generic` module. It takes care of
the message formatting, and you have to implement only the `put` method, which takes message sting as an argument:

```ruby 
class IO < Stoplight::Notifier::Base
  include Generic
   
  private
    
  def put(message)
    @object.puts(message)
  end
end
```

### Rails

Stoplight is designed to work seamlessly with Rails. If you want to use the
in-memory data store, you don't need to do anything special. If you want to use
a persistent data store, you'll need to configure it. Create an initializer for
Stoplight:

``` rb
# config/initializers/stoplight.rb
require 'stoplight'
Stoplight::Light.default_data_store = Stoplight::DataStore::Redis.new(...)
Stoplight::Light.default_notifiers += [Stoplight::Notifier::Logger.new(Rails.logger)]
```

## Advanced usage

### Locking

Although stoplights can operate on their own, occasionally you may want to
override the default behavior. You can lock a light in either the green or red
state using `set_state`.

``` rb
light = Stoplight('example-locked') { true }
# => #<Stoplight::Light:..>
light.run
# => true
light.data_store.set_state(light, Stoplight::State::LOCKED_RED)
# => "locked_red"
light.run
# Stoplight::Error::RedLight: example-locked
```

**Code in locked red lights may still run under certain conditions!** If you
have configured a custom data store and that data store fails, Stoplight will
switch over to using a blank in-memory data store. That means you will lose the
locked state of any stoplights.

You can go back to using the default behavior by unlocking the stoplight.

``` rb
light.data_store.set_state(light, Stoplight::State::UNLOCKED)
```

### Testing

Stoplights typically work as expected without modification in test suites.
However there are a few things you can do to make them behave better. If your
stoplights are spewing messages into your test output, you can silence them
with a couple configuration changes.

``` rb
Stoplight::Light.default_error_notifier = -> _ {}
Stoplight::Light.default_notifiers = []
```

If your tests mysteriously fail because stoplights are the wrong color, you can
try resetting the data store before each test case. For example, this would
give each test case a fresh data store with RSpec.

``` rb
before(:each) do
  Stoplight::Light.default_data_store = Stoplight::DataStore::Memory.new
end
```

Sometimes you may want to test stoplights directly. You can avoid resetting the
data store by giving each stoplight a unique name.

``` rb
stoplight = Stoplight("test-#{rand}") { ... }
```
